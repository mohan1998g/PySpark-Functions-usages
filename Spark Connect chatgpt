Spark Connect is an interface introduced in Apache Spark 3.4 that enables remote clients to connect to a Spark cluster using a 
client-server architecture. This allows users to work with Spark from different environments (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, IDEs) 
by interacting with Spark applications via API calls over network connections.

Here's a list of core Spark SQL functions that Spark Connect supports. 
These functions can be used in queries or DataFrame operations with Spark Connect:


1. Aggregate Functions

avg (or mean)        count        countDistinct        first        last        max        min        sum        approx_count_distinct        
collect_list        collect_set        cor        covar_pop        covar_samp        kurtosis        skewness        stddev        
stddev_pop        stddev_samp        var_pop        var_samp        variance        


2. Window Functions

first_value        last_value


3. Date and Time Functions
current_date        current_timestamp        date_format        year, month, dayofmonth, hour, minute, second
weekofyear        dayofweek        next_day        last_day        months_between        to_date        to_timestamp        add_months
date_add        date_sub        datediff        from_unixtime        unix_timestamp        


4. String Functions
ascii        base64        concat        concat_ws        decode        encode        format_number        initcap
instr        length        lower, upper        ltrim, rtrim, trim        regexp_extract        regexp_replace
split        substring        translate        overlay


5. Math Functions
abs        acos, asin, atan, atan2        bin        ceil        conv        cos, cosh, sin, sinh, tan, tanh
exp        floor        log, log10, log1p        pow or power        round        sqrt        signum        rand, randn        


6. Conditional Functions
coalesce        fnull, isnull        when, otherwise        greatest, least        nvl        nvl2


7. Collection Functions
array        array_contains        explode        posexplode        size        map        map_keys, map_values


8. Data Type Functions
cast        typeof        isnan


9. Miscellaneous Functions
monotonically_increasing_id        input_file_name        spark_partition_id


10. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
udf (Python, Scala, or Java UDFs)
pandas_udf (for vectorized operations with Pandas UDFs)
Notes
SQL Expressions: With Spark Connect, you can still execute SQL expressions that combine these functions, 
just as you would in a typical Spark SQL query.
PySpark, Scala, Java, and R APIs: Most functions are accessible across all Spark-supported languages, but Spark Connect primarily enhances Python API accessibility, which is commonly used in interactive or notebook environments.
API Limitations: While Spark Connect is powerful, it is still expanding its functionality, so some specialized operations may require checking Spark Connectâ€™s compatibility in the version being used.
